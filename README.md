# Wikipedia-QA-using-Langchain-
Devoloped a Question-Answering (Q/A) system using LangChain Core that retrieves and answers user queries based on information from the Wikipedia page on Generative Artificial IntelligenceLinks to an external site..

The solution contains the following components:

- LangChain Core - Constructing the main pipeline for Q/A retrieval.
- MemoryCache - Implementing caching to enhance efficiency and avoid redundant retrievals.
- Function Calling - Using function calling to extract relevant information from structured data.
- Callbacks - Incorporating callback handlers to track and log events during the execution.
